  "reasoning": "Median probability: 55.00%\n\nRun 1 (58%):\n(a) Time left: ~61 days (from Jan 12, 2026 to Mar 14, 2026 ET).\n\n(b) Status quo if nothing changes: **No** (absent a new/expanded, binding US sanctions action explicitly stated to be related to the Ukraine war during the window).\n\n(c) A scenario for **No**: The US continues routine maintenance of existing Russia sanctions (e.g., FAQs, general licenses, enforcement actions, or designations framed as corruption/cyber/terrorism) but **does not** announce any *new or expanded restriction* that is **explicitly** tied in the official announcement to the Ukraine war; or any Ukraine-war-linked package is delayed until after Mar 14.\n\n(d) A scenario for **Yes**: Treasury/OFAC (or State/Commerce/Congress) announces a new sanctions package—e.g., new SDN designations, new sectoral prohibitions, expanded vessel/energy/shipping restrictions, or new export controls—where the press release/fact sheet **explicitly** says it is in response to or intended to pressure Russia regarding **the war in Ukraine**, and it occurs between Jan 12 and Mar 14.\n\nRationale:\n- **Base rate / status quo weighting:** Since 2022, the US has repeatedly used sanctions as a core tool against Russia, and the “default” policy posture has been continued incremental tightening rather than stasis. That said, the resolution criteria are narrower than “any Russia sanctions”: it must be **new or expanded**, **binding**, and **explicitly linked** to the Ukraine war in official materials. That explicit-link requirement is a meaningful filter and increases the chance that actions during the window won’t qualify even if they are Russia-related.\n- **Recent pattern suggests capability and willingness:** Large, explicitly Ukraine-war-framed packages occurred in early 2025 (energy revenue, vessels, evasion networks). OFAC also continued “Russia-/Ukraine-related” actions in late 2025. This supports a non-trivial chance of another package in early 2026.\n- **Near-term catalyst signals:** Reuters (Dec 17, 2025) reported the administration was preparing additional sanctions if Putin rejected a peace deal. That kind of conditional preparation often results in an announced package within weeks to a couple months—squarely inside this question’s window—*if* the diplomatic trigger is met.\n- **But timing and political/diplomatic incentives cut both ways:** If negotiations are ongoing, the US may hold sanctions in reserve as leverage, or coordinate timing with allies, or focus on enforcement rather than new restrictions. Also, some OFAC activity (licenses/FAQs) may occur without constituting “new or expanded restrictions,” and some announcements may avoid explicit “Ukraine war” language (failing the criterion).\n- **Net:** Given (i) the strong historical tendency toward additional Ukraine-war-linked sanctions, (ii) the reported preparation of a new round, but (iii) the short window and the explicit-link/“new restriction” requirements, I land modestly above 50/50.\n\nProbability: 58%\n\n---\n\nRun 2 (62%):\n(a) Time left: ~61 days (from Jan 12, 2026 to Mar 14, 2026 ET).\n\n(b) Status quo if nothing changed: **No** (the question only resolves Yes if a *new or expanded* sanctions restriction is *announced* in a binding legal action during the window and the announcement *explicitly* ties it to the Ukraine war).\n\n(c) No scenario: The US maintains existing Russia sanctions without announcing any new/expanded restrictions explicitly linked to the Ukraine war during the window—e.g., only routine renewals, technical amendments, general licenses/FAQs that clarify or ease compliance, or actions framed as “Russia-related” (cyber, elections, human rights) without explicit Ukraine-war linkage.\n\n(d) Yes scenario: Treasury/State/Commerce (or Congress/White House) announces a new sanctions package in Feb–early Mar 2026—e.g., new SDN designations, new sectoral prohibitions, expanded vessel blocking, tighter oil price-cap enforcement, new export controls/Entity List additions—where the press release/fact sheet explicitly says it is in response to or intended to pressure Russia over “the war in Ukraine” / “Russia’s war of aggression.”\n\nRationale:\nThe base rate since 2022 is that the US frequently rolls out additional Russia sanctions, often in coordinated “packages,” and official communications commonly and explicitly frame them as responses to Russia’s war against Ukraine. The background also notes reporting (Dec 17, 2025) that the administration was preparing additional sanctions to pressure peace negotiations—suggesting a live policy pipeline that could plausibly land inside this ~2‑month window.\n\nHowever, I weight the status quo: even when sanctions policy is active, *this specific resolution* is narrower than “any Russia sanctions.” It requires (1) a binding legal action that is genuinely new or expanded (not just licensing/FAQ maintenance), and (2) explicit Ukraine-war linkage in the announcement. It’s quite possible the US does nothing new in this short window, delays a prepared package, or issues actions framed under other rationales (e.g., cyber, corruption, human rights) that would not count. The Jan 6, 2026 OFAC item (amended general license/FAQs) illustrates how “Russia-related” activity can occur without clearly meeting the “new/expanded restriction” + “explicit Ukraine war” thresholds.\n\nNetting this: the prior frequency and the reported preparation push the probability above 50%, but the short horizon and strict criteria keep it from being extremely high.\n\nProbability: 62%\n\n---\n\nRun 3 (55%):\n(a) Time left: ~61 days (from Jan 12, 2026 to Mar 14, 2026 ET).\n\n(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: **No** (absent a new/expanded, binding sanctions restriction announced in that window *and* explicitly tied in the announcement to the Ukraine war).\n\n(c) No scenario: The US maintains existing Russia sanctions, issues only routine/technical actions (e.g., general license tweaks, FAQs, enforcement actions, or designations framed as “Russia-related” without explicitly citing the Ukraine war), or delays any new package until after Mar 14.\n\n(d) Yes scenario: OFAC/State/Commerce/White House (or Congress) announces a new sanctions package (e.g., new SDN designations, new sectoral prohibitions, new trade/export controls, vessel blocking, or expanded transaction bans) and the accompanying press release/fact sheet explicitly states it is in response to Russia’s war in Ukraine / to pressure Russia regarding the Ukraine war.\n\nRationale:\n- **Base rate / inertia:** Over a ~2‑month horizon, the default is often “no major new binding action,” especially given the question’s *narrow* resolution criteria: it must be (1) new or expanded restriction, (2) binding legal action, and (3) **explicitly** linked to the Ukraine war in official materials. Many plausible US actions (enforcement, indictments, guidance, license adjustments) won’t qualify.\n- **But sanctions cadence is high:** Since 2022 the US has repeatedly added Russia/Ukraine-related sanctions, and 2025 saw large, explicitly war-linked packages (energy, vessels, evasion networks). That raises the likelihood that *some* qualifying action occurs in any given short window.\n- **Recent signal:** Reuters (Dec 17, 2025) reported the administration was preparing additional sanctions to pressure Russia to negotiate. That’s a meaningful leading indicator that a package could land in early 2026.\n- **Window is short and criteria are strict:** Even if the administration is “readying” sanctions, timing can slip; and some actions might be framed under broader “Russia-related” or other rationales without the explicit Ukraine-war language required here.\n\nBalancing the strong ongoing propensity to sanction with the short timeframe and strict wording requirement, I put this modestly above even odds.\n\nProbability: 55%\n\n---\n\nRun 4 (40%):\n(a) Time left: ~61 days (from Jan 12, 2026 to Mar 14, 2026 ET).\n\n(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: **No** (the question only resolves Yes if a *new or expanded* binding sanctions restriction is *announced* in this window and the official announcement *explicitly* ties it to the Ukraine war).\n\n(c) Scenario for **No**: The US makes no new Russia sanctions announcements in the window, or only issues routine maintenance actions (e.g., FAQs, guidance, renewals, general licenses) and/or sanctions actions framed around other rationales (cyber, human rights, corruption, elections) without explicitly stating they are related to the Ukraine war.\n\n(d) Scenario for **Yes**: OFAC/State/Commerce (or Congress/White House) announces a new package—e.g., new SDN designations, expanded sectoral prohibitions, new trade/export controls, vessel blocking, or new transaction bans—where the accompanying press release/fact sheet explicitly says it is in response to Russia’s war in Ukraine / to pressure Russia to end the war.\n\nRationale:\n- **Base rate / status quo weight:** Over a ~2‑month horizon, “no qualifying new sanctions package” is a common outcome even in active sanction regimes, because many weeks pass with only administrative updates or enforcement actions. The resolution criteria are also **strict**: it must be a *new/expanded restriction* and the announcement must *explicitly* link it to the Ukraine war. That excludes a lot of plausible activity.\n- **But meaningful chance of action:** The US has repeatedly issued **large, explicitly war-linked** sanctions rounds (e.g., early 2025 energy and evasion packages). Reuters reporting in Dec 2025 suggested the administration was **preparing additional sanctions** to pressure negotiations—this increases the likelihood of a near-term package.\n- **Window is short but not tiny:** 61 days is enough time for one coordinated package if policy decides to move, especially if there’s a trigger (battlefield escalation, failed talks, major strike, new atrocities, or allied coordination).\n- **Key uncertainty:** Even if the US acts, it might be framed under a different stated rationale (e.g., sanctions evasion, export control enforcement, cyber) or be structured as licensing/GL changes that don’t clearly constitute “new or expanded restrictions,” which would fail the criteria.\n\nNetting these: I’d lean to **No** as the modal outcome, but with a substantial minority chance of a qualifying, explicitly war-linked sanctions announcement in the period.\n\nProbability: 40%\n\n---\n\nRun 5 (45%):\n(a) Time left: ~61 days (from Jan 12, 2026 to Mar 14, 2026 ET).\n\n(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: **No** — absent a new binding legal action announced in that window that **explicitly** says it is related to the Ukraine war, the criteria won’t be met.\n\n(c) Scenario for a **No** outcome: The US continues routine maintenance of existing Russia sanctions (e.g., OFAC FAQs, general licenses, enforcement actions, or designations framed as “Russia-related” without explicitly tying them to the Ukraine war), or delays any new package until after Mar 14, 2026.\n\n(d) Scenario for a **Yes** outcome: Treasury/State/Commerce (or Congress/White House) announces a new sanctions package—e.g., new SDN designations, new sectoral prohibitions, new export controls, or new vessel/energy/trade restrictions—and the accompanying press release/fact sheet explicitly states it is in response to Russia’s war in Ukraine / to pressure Russia to end the war.\n\nRationale:\n- **Base rate / inertia:** The default is “No” because the resolution requires a fairly specific kind of event (a *new or expanded restriction* plus *explicit Ukraine-war linkage* in official materials) within a relatively short ~2‑month window. Many plausible US actions (enforcement, clarifications, licensing tweaks) won’t qualify.\n- **But sanctions cadence is high:** Since 2022, the US has repeatedly issued additional Russia sanctions, often in large, clearly messaged packages. The background also notes reporting (Dec 2025) that the administration was preparing additional sanctions to pressure peace talks—this increases the chance of a qualifying announcement during the window.\n- **Messaging requirement is usually easy to satisfy when it’s a real package:** When the US does a meaningful new round aimed at war financing (energy, shipping, military-industrial base, evasion), it typically includes explicit “war in Ukraine” language in Treasury/State press materials. So the main uncertainty is *whether* a new package is announced in this specific period, not whether it would be explicitly linked.\n- **Net:** I weight the status quo (“no qualifying new package in a 2‑month window”) slightly more than the “yes” case, but only slightly, given the ongoing conflict and recent pattern of frequent, explicitly framed sanctions rounds.\n\nProbability: 45%",
