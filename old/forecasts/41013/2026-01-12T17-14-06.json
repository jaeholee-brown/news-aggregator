There has not yet been an on-the-record announcement from X/xAI/Musk that *the entire* personalized selection and ordering in *For you* (or another personalized feed) is determined **exclusively** by Grok, with only timestamps + hard filters outside Grok.\n\n(c) Scenario for **No**: X continues to describe the system as “Grok-powered” or “incorporating more AI,” but keeps other learned rankers/embeddings/behavioral heuristics in the stack (ads ranking, candidate generation, follow-graph models, safety/risk scoring that affects ranking, etc.), or only rolls out Grok as a partial component / limited experiment. Alternatively, they make no qualifying announcement by the deadline.\n\n(d) Scenario for **Yes**: Before March 12, Musk or X/xAI leadership explicitly states (e.g., in an official post) that Grok now solely determines personalized ranking/ordering for the general *For you* feed (allowing only timestamp + hard filters), possibly with a phased rollout to all users—and no credible source contradicts that claim within 3 days.\n\nRationale:\n- The key constraint is not technical feasibility but **the resolution’s strict wording**: an explicit announcement of **exclusive** Grok control over personalized selection/ordering. Current public info is mostly intent (“delete heuristics,” “Grok taking over”) and partial-integration language (“Grok-powered,” “incorporate more AI”), which often coexists with other models in production.\n- There is some positive momentum: Musk’s Oct 2025 claim suggested a fast transition, and the Jan 2026 “open-source the new algorithm in ~7 days” statement increases the chance of a clarifying announcement. If they actually publish code or a detailed description, they might also make a strong marketing/positioning claim like “Grok runs the feed.”\n- However, the **status quo bias** matters: large recommender systems rarely become *exclusively* one model end-to-end; they typically retain multiple learned components (candidate generation, ranking, quality prediction, ad systems) even if one model is branded as “the algorithm.” Also, even if Grok is heavily used, they may avoid making an exclusivity claim that can be easily challenged by engineers, open-source reviewers, or reporters—raising the risk of contradiction within the 3-day window.\n- Net: I see a meaningful chance of a qualifying announcement in the next ~2 months, but I think “exclusive Grok” is a higher bar than “Grok-powered,” so **No** remains more likely.\n\nProbability: 35%\n\n---\n\nRun 2 (28%):\n(a) Time left: ~59 days (until March 12, 2026 ET).\n\n(b) Status quo if nothing changed: **No**. There has been no qualifying on-the-record announcement that Grok *exclusively* determines the personalized selection and ordering of the *For you* (or another personalized) feed, with only timestamps and hard filters outside Grok.\n\n(c) A scenario resulting in **No**: X continues using a hybrid recommender (e.g., Grok as one model among others, or Grok plus additional learned ranking models/heuristics based on user behavior), or only rolls out a limited beta/pilot, or makes vague “Grok-powered” claims without explicitly stating exclusivity end-to-end for the general user base.\n\n(d) A scenario resulting in **Yes**: Before March 12, 2026, Musk/X/xAI (or a relevant exec) posts an official statement that the *For you* feed’s personalized ranking is now fully handed over to Grok—i.e., Grok is the only learned/personalization component used for selection/ordering (aside from timestamps and hard filters)—possibly with a phased rollout to all users, and no credible contradiction appears within 3 days.\n\nRationale:\n- The resolution bar is unusually strict: it’s not enough that Grok is “powering” or “incorporated into” recommendations; the announcement must clearly assert **exclusive** control over personalized selection/ordering (with only non-personalization hard filters allowed outside Grok). Most public comms about recommender changes are marketing-level and ambiguous, which is a strong pull toward the status quo (**No**).\n- Evidence so far (Oct 2025 “delete heuristics in 4–6 weeks,” Jan 2026 “open-source the new algorithm soon”) indicates intent and ongoing work, but does not meet the explicit exclusivity criterion. Also, recommender systems at X scale typically retain multiple models, guardrails, and fallback rankers; even if “heuristics” are removed, there may still be other learned components besides Grok.\n- On the other hand, there is a plausible path to **Yes** within ~2 months because: (1) Musk has already publicly framed this as a concrete near-term transition; (2) the promised open-sourcing could create pressure/opportunity to describe the architecture in more definitive terms; and (3) the question only requires an announcement (not independent technical verification), as long as it isn’t credibly contradicted within 3 days.\n- Netting this out: I overweight the base rate that large platforms rarely make (or can safely make) such absolute “exclusive model” claims, and that internal reality is likely messier than the criterion allows. But I still assign meaningful probability given Musk’s prior explicitness and the short horizon.\n\nProbability: 28%\n\n---\n\nRun 3 (28%):\n(a) Time left: ~59 days (until March 12, 2026 ET).\n\n(b) Status quo if nothing changed: **No**. There has not yet been an on-the-record announcement that Grok *exclusively* determines the entire personalized selection and ordering of the *For you* (or another personalized) feed, with only timestamps and hard filters outside Grok.\n\n(c) Scenario for **No**: X continues to describe the system as “Grok-powered” or “incorporating more AI,” but keeps other learned rankers/heuristics (e.g., separate engagement models, candidate-generation/reranking stacks, follow-graph models, ad-ranking models) in the loop; or X never makes a clear exclusivity announcement to the general user base before the deadline (or makes one that is credibly contradicted within 3 days).\n\n(d) Scenario for **Yes**: Before March 12, 2026, Musk/X/xAI explicitly announces (on an official channel or on the record) that Grok now solely determines personalized ranking/selection for the general *For you* feed (allowing only timestamps + hard filters outside Grok), possibly noting a phased rollout to all users; and no credible source contradicts the claim within 3 days.\n\nRationale:\n- The bar for “Yes” is unusually strict: it’s not enough that Grok is a major component; X must claim **exclusive** control of personalized selection/ordering by Grok, with no other learned models or behavior-based heuristics. In large-scale recommenders, fully removing all other learned components is operationally risky and atypical; even if Grok is central, there are usually auxiliary models for candidate generation, quality/safety, and ads optimization that may still use learned signals (which would fail the criterion unless they’re “hard filters” only).\n- The strongest public evidence so far is Musk’s Oct 2025 intent (“delete heuristics” in 4–6 weeks) and Jan 2026 reporting about open-sourcing a “new algorithm” and “incorporating more AI through Grok.” Both point toward increased Grok integration, but neither meets the resolution requirement of an explicit exclusivity announcement.\n- Status quo inertia matters: with ~2 months left, the most likely path is continued incremental integration and messaging (“Grok-powered”), not a clean, auditable “Grok-only” declaration. The open-sourcing plan could create an opportunity for a definitive statement, but it could also reveal (or imply) multiple components, making an exclusivity claim less likely.\n- Still, Musk has shown willingness to make bold, categorical product claims on X, and the company may want a clear narrative (“Grok runs the feed now”) for marketing/strategic reasons. That keeps a non-trivial chance of a qualifying announcement before the deadline.\n\nProbability: 28%\n\n---\n\nRun 4 (22%):\n(a) Time left: ~59 days (until March 12, 2026 ET).\n\n(b) Status quo if nothing changed: **No**. There has been talk of Grok “taking over” or being “incorporated,” but no qualifying announcement that Grok *exclusively* determines personalized selection/ordering for the *For you* (or another general personalized) feed.\n\n(c) Scenario for **No**: X continues using a hybrid recommender (Grok as one component among others), or only rolls out Grok-ranking as a limited experiment/beta, or never makes an explicit exclusivity claim meeting the resolution criteria (or credible sources contradict it within 3 days).\n\n(d) Scenario for **Yes**: Before March 12, an official X/xAI channel (or Musk/executive on the record) announces that the *For you* (or another general personalized feed) is now end-to-end personalized exclusively by Grok (with only timestamps + hard filters outside Grok), possibly via a phased rollout to the general user base, and no credible contradiction appears within 3 days.\n\nRationale:\n- The resolution bar is unusually strict: it’s not “Grok-powered” or “mostly Grok,” but **exclusive** use of Grok for learned/personalized ranking, with only non-personalization hard filters allowed outside it. Many real-world recommender stacks keep multiple models (retrieval, ranking, safety, diversity, ads) and business rules; even if Grok is central, claiming *exclusive* control is a strong, potentially risky statement to make publicly.\n- The main evidence so far is (1) Musk’s Oct 2025 intent/timeline to “delete heuristics” and have Grok read everything, and (2) Jan 2026 reporting about open-sourcing a “new algorithm” and “incorporating more AI through Grok.” Both are consistent with substantial Grok integration, but neither satisfies the explicit exclusivity announcement requirement.\n- World-changes-slowly consideration: even if engineering work is underway, getting to “Grok is the only personalization brain” across the full general user base, and then choosing to **announce it in the required form**, is a further step. The remaining ~2 months is not long, and the most likely path is continued incremental integration without a clean exclusivity declaration.\n- Upside risk: Musk has previously made bold, definitive product statements on X, and the open-sourcing push could coincide with a clear “Grok now runs the feed” announcement. If they want to market Grok and simplify the story, they might over-claim. That said, the question requires *no credible contradiction* within 3 days; if the open-sourced code or knowledgeable reporting shows other learned components, that would likely block resolution.\n\nProbability: 22%\n\n---\n\nRun 5 (32%):\n(a) Time left: ~59 days (until March 12, 2026 ET).\n\n(b) Status quo if nothing changed: **No**. There has been talk of Grok “taking over” or being “incorporated,” but no qualifying announcement that Grok *exclusively* determines the personalized selection and ordering of the *For you* (or another personalized) feed.\n\n(c) Scenario for **No**: X continues using a hybrid recommender (Grok plus other learned models/heuristics, embeddings, candidate generators, engagement predictors, or hand-tuned ranking logic), or only rolls out a Grok-based feed as a limited beta/experiment, or makes vague claims (“Grok-powered”) without explicitly stating exclusivity; alternatively, an exclusivity claim is quickly contradicted by credible reporting/technical evidence.\n\n(d) Scenario for **Yes**: Before March 12, an official X/xAI channel or Musk/executive states on the record that the *For you* (or another general-audience personalized feed) is now end-to-end personalized **exclusively by Grok**, with only timestamps and hard filters outside Grok, possibly with a phased rollout to all users; no credible contradiction appears within 3 days.\n\nRationale:\nThe base rate/status quo strongly favors **No** because the resolution bar is unusually strict: it’s not enough that Grok is a major component; X must claim *exclusive* use of Grok for personalization, disallowing any other learned model or heuristic using user behavior/inferred interests. Large-scale recommenders typically remain modular (separate candidate generation, filtering, ranking, ads blending, safety/risk models), and even if Grok is central, organizations often retain auxiliary learned systems for performance, safety, and business constraints. That makes a true “Grok-only personalization” architecture less likely—and even if internally true, it’s an additional step for X to *announce it clearly* in a way that meets the market’s criteria.\n\nOn the other hand, there are meaningful pro-Yes signals: Musk explicitly said in Oct 2025 that Grok would take over and heuristics would be deleted on a short timeline, and in Jan 2026 he reportedly planned to open-source the “new algorithm” soon. Those increase the chance of a near-term, definitive statement (or an open-source drop that is accompanied by an explicit “Grok exclusively runs it” claim). Also, Musk has a pattern of making bold, simplifying public claims about systems being “fully” X or “entirely” Y, which could produce the needed wording even if the underlying system is more complex—though that also raises contradiction risk.\n\nNetting this out: with ~2 months left, I’d still overweight inertia and the difficulty of meeting the *exclusivity + official announcement + no-contradiction* threshold, but assign a non-trivial chance given Musk’s prior statement and the impending “open-source algorithm” moment that could be used to declare completion.\n\nProbability: 32%",
