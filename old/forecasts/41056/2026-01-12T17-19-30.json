Unless a qualifying announcement is made in the window, the criteria won’t be met.\n\n(c) **No scenario:** Utilities discuss data-center load growth but either (i) don’t revise multi-year capex guidance, (ii) raise capex by **< $5B**, (iii) extend the plan over **>5 years**, or (iv) raise capex for other reasons (reliability, renewables, storms) without explicitly citing data centers as a factor.\n\n(d) **Yes scenario:** During late-Jan to early-Mar 2026 earnings/updates, at least one US electric utility (e.g., a large wires utility in PJM/ERCOT/Southeast) **raises its ≤5-year capex plan by ≥$5B** versus prior guidance and explicitly attributes part of the increase to **data center demand / large load interconnections / AI-driven load growth**.\n\n## Rationale\nThe base rate is meaningfully positive: in 2025 multiple utilities made very large multi-year capex plan increases and explicitly tied them to data centers (Dominion +$6.9B over 5 years; Duke reportedly ~+$10B; others smaller). That establishes that (1) management teams are willing to re-rate capex plans midstream, (2) the “data center demand” narrative is already an accepted justification, and (3) the $5B threshold is achievable.\n\nHowever, I weight the status quo heavily: a **specific** combination must occur in a **short** 2-month window—**announcement**, **≥$5B incremental**, **≤5-year horizon**, and **data centers cited**. Many updates will fail on one of these (common failure modes: incremental increase is $1–4B; horizon is 6–10 years; or data centers are mentioned as context but not as a stated driver of the capex increase). Also, several big revisions already happened in 2025, which may “pull forward” some of the easiest qualifying events, reducing near-term probability.\n\nCountervailing that, the window overlaps with a period when utilities often give guidance updates (earnings season and investor updates), and the ongoing “capex super-cycle” plus fast-moving interconnection queues makes another large revision plausible—especially if a utility signs/announces a major data center contract or receives regulatory clarity enabling accelerated transmission build.\n\nNetting these: I see a **moderate** chance of at least one qualifying announcement, but **No** remains the single most likely outcome given the tight window and strict thresholds.\n\nProbability: 35%\n\n---\n\nRun 2 (35%):\n(a) **Time left:** 59 days (from **Jan 13 to Mar 12, 2026**, ending before **Mar 13, 2026 ET**).\n\n(b) **Status quo if nothing changes:** **No** — absent a new qualifying announcement in the window, the criteria won’t be met.\n\n(c) **No scenario (brief):** Utilities discuss data-center load growth but either (i) don’t revise capex plans, (ii) revise by **< $5B**, (iii) revise over a horizon **> 5 years**, or (iv) revise by ≥$5B but **don’t cite data centers** as a factor (e.g., framing it as reliability, wildfire, renewables, or general load growth without mentioning data centers).\n\n(d) **Yes scenario (brief):** During Q4’25 earnings season / early-2026 investor updates, a US electric utility **raises its 5-year (or shorter) capex plan by ≥$5B** versus prior guidance and explicitly attributes the increase at least partly to **data center demand** (similar to Dominion’s Feb 2025 pattern).\n\n## Rationale\nThe base rate over the last year is meaningfully positive: multiple US utilities have already made **multi-year capex step-ups** explicitly tied to data centers, and several were **very large** (≥$5B) in 2025. That suggests (1) data-center-driven load is a salient, board-level driver and (2) management teams are willing to re-rate multi-year plans when interconnection queues and contracted load firm up.\n\nHowever, I weight the status quo: most companies **do not** change multi-year capex guidance in any given two-month window, and even when they do, many revisions will fail one of the tight filters (≥$5B *increase*, ≤5-year horizon, and explicit data-center citation). Also, some of the “big” 2025 revisions may have already pulled forward the obvious updates, reducing near-term need for another ≥$5B step-up immediately in early 2026.\n\nNetting this: the window coincides with a period when utilities often provide updates (earnings calls, investor days), and the theme is strong enough that at least one qualifying announcement is plausible—but still not the modal outcome.\n\n**Probability: 35%**\n\n---\n\nRun 3 (40%):\n(a) **Time left:** 59 days (from 2026-01-13 through 2026-03-12 ET).\n\n(b) **Status quo if nothing changes:** **No**. Unless a utility makes (and publicizes) a specific qualifying capex-plan *increase* in that window, the criteria won’t be met.\n\n(c) **A scenario for a No outcome:** Utilities discuss data-center load growth but either (i) don’t revise multi-year capex guidance during the window, (ii) announce increases smaller than **$5B**, (iii) extend the horizon beyond **5 years** (e.g., “through 2031/2035”), or (iv) raise capex for reliability/renewables/transmission without explicitly citing **data centers** as a factor in the increase.\n\n(d) **A scenario for a Yes outcome:** During late-Jan to Feb earnings season, a large US regulated utility (or wires-heavy utility) updates its **≤5-year** capital plan and explicitly says it is **raising** planned capex by **≥$5B** versus prior guidance, with **data center demand** (AI/data centers/large load customers) cited as a driver (even if not the only driver).\n\n## Rationale\n\nThis is a **narrow time window** (two months) but it overlaps with a period when many utilities provide **annual guidance updates** (Q4 earnings, investor updates), which is when multi-year capex plans are commonly refreshed. The background shows a **recent base rate** of large, discrete plan increases tied to data centers (e.g., Dominion +$6.9B over five years in Feb 2025; multiple other large 2025 increases). That suggests the underlying driver (data-center interconnection queues, contracted load, and required T&D buildout) is strong enough that additional revisions are plausible.\n\nHowever, I put extra weight on the **status quo**: most companies will *not* make a **new** ≥$5B upward revision in any given two-month window, because (1) many already “reset” their plans in 2025, (2) some will wait for regulatory clarity, signed contracts, or integrated resource plan cycles, and (3) even when load is rising, guidance changes often come as **smaller increments**, **longer horizons**, or are described without a clean “increase vs prior plan” figure that meets the resolution criteria.\n\nNetting this out: the chance is meaningfully above trivial (because the sector is in a capex “super-cycle” and the window coincides with guidance season), but still more likely than not that **no** qualifying announcement occurs in this specific window.\n\n**Probability: 40%**\n\n---\n\nRun 4 (35%):\n(a) Time left: ~59 days (from 2026-01-13 through 2026-03-12 ET).\n\n(b) Status quo if nothing changes: **No** (no qualifying announcement occurs in the window).\n\n(c) Scenario for **No**: Utilities discuss data-center load growth but either (i) don’t revise multi-year capex guidance during this period, (ii) raise capex by < $5B, (iii) extend the plan over >5 years, or (iv) increase capex for reliability/clean energy/transmission without explicitly citing data centers as a factor.\n\n(d) Scenario for **Yes**: A large US utility uses a Q4 2025 or Q1 2026 earnings release/call (common in late Jan–Feb) to **raise its 3–5 year capex plan by ≥$5B** and explicitly attributes part of the increase to **data center-driven load growth** (e.g., new large-load interconnection queue, signed data center contracts, or “AI/data centers” cited as a driver).\n\nRationale:\nThe base rate in 2025 shows that **data-center-driven multi-year capex step-ups of ≥$5B do happen**, and they often get announced around **earnings season**—which overlaps heavily with this question’s window. That pushes probability upward.\n\nHowever, the resolution criteria are fairly specific: it must be an **incremental increase vs prior guidance**, **≥$5B**, **≤5-year horizon**, and **data centers must be cited**. Many utilities will already have updated plans in late 2025; once a company has “reset” its multi-year plan, another ≥$5B upward revision within the next 1–4 months is less common. Also, some announcements may be framed as new long-range (e.g., 10-year) plans, smaller annual bumps, or general load growth without explicitly naming data centers—any of which would fail the criteria.\n\nGiven (1) a meaningful but not dominant frequency of qualifying events, (2) the short window, and (3) the strong status-quo pull toward “no new qualifying announcement,” I land on a moderate probability.\n\nProbability: 35%\n\n---\n\nRun 5 (35%):\n(a) Time left: 59 days (from Jan 13 to Mar 12, 2026 ET).\n\n(b) Status quo if nothing changes: **No** (because no qualifying announcement has yet occurred in the Jan 13–Mar 12, 2026 window).\n\n(c) Scenario for **No**: Utilities discuss data-center load growth but either (i) don’t revise multi-year capex guidance in this window, (ii) revise by **< $5B**, (iii) revise over a horizon **> 5 years**, or (iv) revise for other reasons (reliability, renewables, storms) without explicitly citing data centers as a factor.\n\n(d) Scenario for **Yes**: A large US utility (e.g., one with heavy data-center exposure or fast-growing load) uses a Q4 2025 earnings release / investor update in late Jan–Feb 2026 to **raise its 3–5 year capex plan by ≥ $5B** and explicitly attributes part of the increase to **data center demand / large load interconnections**.\n\nRationale:\n- **Base rate / precedent:** In 2025 there were multiple examples of exactly this pattern (Dominion +$6.9B over 5 years; Duke reportedly +~$10B; AEP +$16B; Xcel +$15B; DTE +$6.5B), often communicated around earnings and multi-year plan refresh cycles. That establishes that “≥$5B, ≤5-year, data-centers-cited” announcements are plausible and not rare in the current environment.\n- **But weight the status quo:** The question asks for a *new* qualifying announcement in a **tight 2‑month window**. Even if the annual rate of such announcements is meaningful, compressing into ~59 days reduces probability. Also, many big utilities already updated plans in 2H 2025; some may not revisit again so soon unless there’s a discrete trigger (major contracted load, regulatory filing, or a strategic plan reset).\n- **Timing considerations:** The window overlaps with a common period for **Q4/full-year earnings** and **capex plan refreshes** (late Jan through Feb), which increases the chance of an announcement. Still, not every earnings cycle produces a ≥$5B upward revision; many updates are incremental or framed as longer-horizon “through 2030” plans (which would fail the ≤5-year criterion).\n- **Threshold is high but achievable:** $5B over ≤5 years is large, but recent “super-cycle” dynamics and transformer/T&D constraints can force step-changes when a utility signs/forecasts several GW of new large-load interconnections. Data centers are a salient, frequently cited driver, so the “citing data centers” condition is not especially restrictive if a big capex bump occurs.\n\nOverall, I see a meaningful chance but still favor **No** because (i) the window is short and (ii) many firms may have already incorporated near-term data-center expectations into late-2025 guidance.\n\nProbability: 35%",
