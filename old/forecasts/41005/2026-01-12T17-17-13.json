  "reasoning": "Median probability: 62.00%\n\nRun 1 (62%):\n(a) Time left: 60 days (from Jan 12 to Mar 13, 2026 ET, inclusive; checked on/after Mar 14).\n\n(b) Status quo if nothing changed: **No** — as of the start of the window, the count within the window is 0, and absent any new AI-industry layoff entries on layoffs.fyi during Jan 12–Mar 13, it would remain below 100.\n\n(c) Scenario for **No**: AI hiring/financing stays strong enough that only small, scattered cuts occur (or cuts occur but are categorized under other industries on layoffs.fyi), totaling <100 AI-industry layoffs recorded in that date range.\n\n(d) Scenario for **Yes**: One or two mid-sized AI companies (or an AI division within a larger firm that layoffs.fyi categorizes as “AI”) announce layoffs of ~100+ combined during the window—e.g., a single event of 100+ or several events (20–50 each) that sum to ≥100.\n\nRationale:\nThe base rate matters most here: the threshold is only **100 layoffs over ~2 months**, which is low relative to typical tech-layoff volatility, and the background notes already cite **800+ AI-industry layoffs in 2025** on layoffs.fyi (with a large chunk from a single event). That pattern suggests the AI category can register meaningful counts when even one notable company cuts staff.\n\nKey uncertainty is *classification and capture*: layoffs.fyi depends on reported events and assigns an “Industry” label. Some “AI-related” layoffs may be filed under broader tech categories rather than “AI,” which would push toward No. But given the ongoing churn in tech and the plausibility of at least one discrete layoff event in the AI sector over 60 days, I lean Yes.\n\nI’ll overweight the status quo (no new events yet) but still treat ≥100 as more likely than not because a single moderate layoff can clear the bar.\n\nProbability: 62%\n\n---\n\nRun 2 (45%):\n(a) **Time left:** 60 days (from Jan 12 to Mar 13, 2026, inclusive; checked on/after Mar 14, 2026 ET).\n\n(b) **Status quo if nothing changed:** **No** — if no additional AI-industry layoff events are recorded on layoffs.fyi during the window, the total added layoffs would be 0, which is below 100.\n\n(c) **Scenario for a No:** The AI sector stays relatively stable through early Q1: hiring slows but companies avoid discrete layoff announcements; any reductions are small (<100 total), handled via attrition or quiet cuts that don’t get reported/captured by layoffs.fyi’s AI industry filter.\n\n(d) **Scenario for a Yes:** One mid-sized AI company (or a couple of smaller ones) announces a layoff round totaling ≥100, or several smaller AI startups each cut 20–50 employees and the cumulative total reaches 100+; layoffs.fyi captures these as “AI” industry entries dated within Jan 12–Mar 13.\n\n### Rationale\nThe threshold (100 layoffs over ~2 months) is low in absolute terms, but the key uncertainty is **whether layoffs.fyi will record ≥100 layoffs specifically tagged to the “AI” industry** in that window. The background suggests AI-related layoffs have occurred (e.g., 800+ in 2025, with a large share from a single event), implying that **sporadic, lumpy events** can easily clear 100 when they happen. However, the status quo in any given short window is often “no major event,” and the provided materials don’t show a clear, ongoing cadence of AI-industry layoff postings that would mechanically accumulate to 100 absent a notable announcement.\n\nSo I weight toward “No” as the default, but not strongly: given continued tech volatility and the ease of crossing 100 with just one moderate layoff round, “Yes” remains quite plausible.\n\nProbability: 45%\n\n---\n\nRun 3 (62%):\n(a) **Time left:** 60 days (from Jan 12 to Mar 13, 2026 inclusive; resolution checked on/after Mar 14, 2026).\n\n(b) **Status quo if nothing changed:** **No** — if no additional AI-industry layoff events are recorded on layoffs.fyi during the window, the count would stay below 100.\n\n(c) **No scenario:** The AI sector has a relatively calm Q1 (funding remains available, no major AI labs or big-model product lines are canceled), and any layoffs that do occur are either (i) outside the “AI” industry tag on layoffs.fyi, (ii) small (tens of people) and/or not captured by the tracker by the check date, leaving the total under 100.\n\n(d) **Yes scenario:** One or two mid-sized AI companies (or a single larger, well-covered AI firm) announce layoffs totaling ≥100 during the window, or several smaller AI startups each cut 20–50 employees and collectively exceed 100; layoffs.fyi captures and tags these as **Industry = AI** by the time Metaculus checks.\n\n## Rationale\nThe threshold (≥100 AI-industry layoffs over ~2 months) is low in absolute terms, but the key uncertainty is **base rate + classification + capture** on layoffs.fyi’s *Industry = AI* filter.\n\n**Status quo weighting:** absent a specific known upcoming layoff, the default expectation is “no big discrete shock.” However, the broader environment entering 2026 features continued tech cost-cutting and “AI realignment” narratives, and 2025 already saw nontrivial AI-industry layoffs on layoffs.fyi (per the prompt, >800 in 2025, with a large chunk from one event). That suggests (i) layoffs do happen in this category and (ii) a single event can clear 100 easily.\n\n**Base-rate reasoning:** If 2025 had ~800 AI-industry layoffs, that averages ~67/month. Over two months that’s ~134—already above 100—though 2025 appears lumpy (e.g., xAI). If 2026 Q1 is less intense than 2025’s average, the total could still plausibly exceed 100 via one moderate event or several small ones. Conversely, if 2025’s total was dominated by a few one-offs and the “typical” month is much lower, then failing to hit 100 becomes plausible.\n\n**Tracker/definition risk:** The question is not “AI-related layoffs” broadly; it’s layoffs.fyi entries tagged **Industry = AI**. Some layoffs at big tech firms working heavily on AI may be tagged as another industry (or not tagged AI), which could suppress counts relative to the general “AI layoffs” discourse.\n\nBalancing (1) a low numeric threshold and historical evidence that the AI category can accumulate hundreds per year, against (2) lumpiness and tagging/capture uncertainty, I lean modestly toward **Yes**.\n\nProbability: 62%\n\n---\n\nRun 4 (55%):\n(a) Time left until outcome is known: **60 days** (from Jan 12 to Mar 13, 2026 inclusive; checked on/after Mar 14, 2026 ET).\n\n(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: **No** (0 layoffs in the window so far, since the window starts today).\n\n(c) Scenario resulting in a **No** outcome: AI hiring remains strong and any cuts are either (i) small (e.g., a few dozen at scattered startups), (ii) categorized by layoffs.fyi under non‑AI industries (e.g., “Crypto,” “Hardware,” “Consumer,” etc.), or (iii) simply not captured/confirmed by layoffs.fyi by the check date—keeping the AI-filtered total **<100** for Jan 12–Mar 13.\n\n(d) Scenario resulting in a **Yes** outcome: One mid-sized AI company (or a couple of smaller ones) announces a clear layoff event that layoffs.fyi tags as **Industry = AI**, totaling **≥100** in this period (e.g., a single 120-person reduction at an AI startup, or three events of ~40 each), and it is recorded on layoffs.fyi by mid-March.\n\nRationale:\n- The threshold is **low (100)** over **~2 months**, so a single moderate layoff at an “AI” categorized firm could clear it. Given the continued high churn in tech and the existence of prior AI-industry layoffs on layoffs.fyi (e.g., hundreds in 2025 per the prompt), the base rate of *some* AI layoffs in any given two-month window seems meaningful.\n- However, I weight the status quo heavily: absent a specific known upcoming layoff, the default is that nothing forces a ≥100 event to occur in this narrow window. Also, classification risk matters: even if “AI-related” layoffs happen, layoffs.fyi may tag the company under another industry, which would not count here.\n- Netting these: I see “at least one ≥100 AI-tagged layoff event recorded in 60 days” as somewhat more likely than not, but not by a lot.\n\nProbability: 55%\n\n---\n\nRun 5 (65%):\n(a) Time left: 60 days (from Jan 12 to Mar 13, 2026, inclusive; resolution checked on/after Mar 14, 2026 ET).\n\n(b) Status quo if nothing changed: **No** — if no AI-industry layoff events are recorded on layoffs.fyi during the window, the total would stay below 100.\n\n(c) Scenario for **No**: AI companies keep hiring/holding steady through Q1; any cuts are small (e.g., a few startups doing <50-person reductions) or are categorized by layoffs.fyi under other industries (e.g., “Crypto,” “Consumer,” “Hardware,” “Other”), so the **AI** filter sums to <100 for Jan 12–Mar 13.\n\n(d) Scenario for **Yes**: One or two mid-sized AI labs / AI tooling companies (or a large tech company’s AI unit that layoffs.fyi tags as **Industry = AI**) announce layoffs of ~100+ combined in this period; alternatively several smaller AI startups shut down and collectively exceed 100, and layoffs.fyi captures and tags them as AI.\n\nRationale:\nThe base rate matters most here: the threshold is only **100 layoffs over ~2 months**, which is low relative to the general level of tech labor churn described in the background and consistent with the idea that layoffs.fyi is continuously adding events. Even if “AI bubble burst” narratives are overstated, routine funding resets, post-hype consolidation, and startup shutdowns can easily generate 100+ layoffs across the AI-labeled slice—provided layoffs.fyi tags them as **AI** (the main uncertainty). The status quo is “No,” but the bar is low enough that modest ongoing turbulence likely clears it. I’d still discount somewhat for classification/coverage risk and for the possibility that early 2026 is calmer than late 2025.\n\nProbability: 65%",
