  "reasoning": "Median probability: 18.00%\n\nRun 1 (18%):\n(a) Time left: ~61 days (from 2026-01-12 to just before 2026-03-14 ET).\n\n(b) Status quo if nothing changed: **No**. Current public reporting indicates the newly permitted ceiling is **H200** (with licensing/fees), with no public permission for anything more capable.\n\n(c) A “No” scenario: The US continues allowing (or reconsidering) **H200** exports only, while keeping **B200/GB200-class** (or any other >H200-by-these-metrics GPU) restricted; no qualifying “better than H200” shipments occur, and no clear public statement authorizes them.\n\n(d) A “Yes” scenario: The White House/Commerce publicly announces that **B200/GB200** (or another Nvidia GPU exceeding H200 on FP8 and HBM bandwidth) will be permitted for export to mainland China (possibly with a fee/cap/licensing), or such GPUs begin shipping to China without credible reporting of violations or enforcement.\n\nRationale:\n- **Base rate / inertia:** Export controls on advanced compute have shown strong path dependence since 2022: iterative tightening/patching, with Nvidia responding via compliant SKUs. A sudden additional loosening beyond H200 within ~2 months would be a meaningful policy step, and meaningful policy steps usually require process, coordination, and political buy-in—especially given the national-security framing.\n- **What we actually see now:** The information environment is dominated by **H200**: licensing “near completion,” planned shipments, and even China-side hesitation. There is also reporting of an ongoing **US review** of advanced Nvidia chip sales to China. That combination (review + controversy) is more consistent with *holding the line* at the newly set ceiling than quickly expanding it again.\n- **What “Yes” requires is specific and high bar:** It’s not enough that Nvidia *could* design a new China SKU; the resolution needs either (i) a **clear public US statement permitting** export of a GPU that is unambiguously **better than H200** by the given FP8/HBM thresholds, or (ii) **actual exports** of such GPUs without credible violation/enforcement reporting. Either would likely be highly visible and contested, making it less likely to slip through quietly.\n- **Upside risk:** The recent H200 permission itself shows the policy can shift. If the administration is explicitly trading access for fees/controls, it’s conceivable they extend the framework to a higher tier (e.g., capped volumes of B200/GB200). But doing so before mid-March looks like a relatively fast follow-on move.\n\nProbability: 18%\n\n---\n\nRun 2 (18%):\n(a) Time left: ~61 days (from 2026-01-12 to 2026-03-14 ET).\n\n(b) Status quo if nothing changed: **No**. The only clearly permitted top-end Nvidia export to China being discussed publicly is **H200**, and there’s no public permission (or clean, uncontested exports) for anything *better than H200*.\n\n(c) A scenario resulting in **No**: The US keeps the current “H200 is the ceiling” posture through March 14, 2026—possibly with continued case-by-case licensing/review—and Nvidia does not ship (or is not publicly allowed to ship) B200/GB200-class or other post-H200 parts to mainland China. Any attempted shipments of better-than-H200 parts are blocked, require licenses not granted, or trigger credible reporting of violations/enforcement.\n\n(d) A scenario resulting in **Yes**: The White House/Commerce publicly announces (or the President posts credibly) that exports of **B200/GB200** (or another Nvidia GPU meeting the >4 PFLOPS FP8 and ≥4.8 TB/s HBM bandwidth thresholds) are permitted to mainland China—potentially under a tariff/fee or a licensing framework—or such GPUs begin shipping to China and are widely reported as lawful with no credible violation/enforcement reporting.\n\nRationale:\nThe resolution requires a *step beyond* the already-notable policy shift allowing H200 exports. That shift is itself recent and politically contentious, and reporting indicates ongoing scrutiny/review of advanced AI chip sales. Given the short horizon (~2 months), the default expectation is policy inertia: governments rarely expand a sensitive export-control relaxation again so quickly, especially after having just moved the line to H200 and while the issue remains under active review and domestic political attention.\n\nFor **Yes** to happen, at least one of two things must occur quickly: (1) an explicit public permission statement covering a better-than-H200 GPU, or (2) actual exports of such GPUs that are not credibly alleged to violate controls and don’t trigger enforcement reporting. Both are plausible but face friction: the US would be knowingly authorizing an even more capable class of accelerators than the newly allowed H200, and Nvidia would likely avoid shipping such parts into China without very clear authorization because the downside risk (enforcement, reputational harm, supply disruption) is high. Also, Nvidia’s prior pattern under tightening controls has been to design *compliant, scaled* China variants—whereas “better than H200” (by FP8 and bandwidth) likely corresponds to frontier parts (e.g., B200/GB200-class) that are exactly what controls aim to constrain.\n\nCountervailing considerations: the precedent of a presidentially driven policy shift (H200 + 25% fee) shows that sudden changes are possible, and a transactional “permit with fee/licensing” approach could extend to even higher-end parts. But doing so before mid-March 2026 would be a second major loosening in a very short window, which seems less likely than holding at the new status quo.\n\nProbability: 18%\n\n---\n\nRun 3 (15%):\n(a) Time left: ~61 days (from 2026-01-12 to 2026-03-14 ET).\n\n(b) Status quo if nothing changed: **No**. Current public policy/shipment news supports H200 being permitted (with conditions/fees), but **no public permission** and no cleanly reported exports for any Nvidia GPU *better than H200*.\n\n(c) Scenario for **No**: The US keeps the current ceiling effectively at H200 through March 14, 2026—licenses/shipments proceed (or stall) for H200, while anything above H200 (e.g., B200/GB200-class) remains explicitly restricted, unaddressed, or stuck in “review,” and any attempted higher-end shipments are either blocked or reported as violations/enforcement risks.\n\n(d) Scenario for **Yes**: The White House/Commerce makes (or the President posts) a clear statement that exports to mainland China will be permitted for a post‑H200 Nvidia GPU meeting the thresholds (FP8 > 4 PFLOPS and HBM ≥ 4.8 TB/s)—or such GPUs are shipped into China and widely reported as legitimate (no credible violation/enforcement reporting) before March 14.\n\nRationale:\n- **Base rate / inertia:** Export-control regimes and their exceptions tend to move slowly, especially for *further loosening* after a high-profile change. The recent H200 permission looks like a discrete, politically salient adjustment; extending permission again to even more capable parts within ~2 months would be another major step and would likely trigger visible interagency process and backlash.\n- **Information in hand:** Reporting through early Jan 2026 is tightly centered on **H200** approvals, reviews, and China-side deliberation—no credible signals of imminent permission for B200/GB200-class hardware. The Reuters-noted “review” dynamic is more consistent with **tightening or holding** than with rapid additional loosening.\n- **What must happen for Yes is demanding:** Resolution requires either (i) an unambiguous public US statement permitting export of a better-than-H200 GPU, or (ii) actual exports that are not credibly alleged to violate controls. Both are high-visibility events; absence of any early indicators reduces near-term probability.\n- **But not impossible:** The administration already demonstrated willingness to carve out a major exception (H200 with a fee). If the policy logic is shifting toward revenue/tariff-style management rather than hard denial, a further step-up could happen quickly—especially via presidential statement. Still, that would be a substantial escalation in capability transfer beyond the newly set “allowed ceiling,” making it less likely than not in this short window.\n\nProbability: 15%\n\n---\n\nRun 4 (12%):\n(a) Time left: ~61 days (from 2026-01-12 to 2026-03-14 ET).\n\n(b) Status quo if nothing changed: **No**. Current public policy/press reporting supports H200 being permitted (with a fee/licensing), but not any Nvidia GPU clearly *better than H200* (e.g., B200/GB200-class) being permitted for export to mainland China.\n\n(c) A No scenario: The US maintains the current ceiling at H200 (or even re-tightens after review/political pushback). No public statement authorizes B200/GB200 (or any >H200-by-metrics GPU), and no such GPUs are shipped to China without credible reporting of violations/enforcement.\n\n(d) A Yes scenario: The White House/Commerce publicly announces that exports of a post‑H200 Nvidia GPU (meeting >4 PFLOPS FP8 and ≥4.8 TB/s HBM bandwidth) will be permitted to China—possibly via a new “tariff/fee + licensing” framework—or such GPUs begin shipping to China with no credible reporting that shipments violate controls or trigger enforcement.\n\nRationale:\n- **Base rate / inertia:** Export controls on advanced compute to China have generally tightened over time, with only narrow, managed carve-outs (A800/H800 then banned; H20 briefly restricted; now H200 allowed with a fee). That pattern suggests the system is politically and bureaucratically “sticky,” and further loosening to *even more capable than H200* within ~2 months is unlikely.\n- **Near-term policy attention points the other way:** Reuters-reported “review” of advanced Nvidia sales to China and ongoing controversy implies heightened scrutiny. In such an environment, authorizing B200/GB200-class exports would be a conspicuous escalation and would likely require explicit, defendable public justification—hard to do quickly without backlash.\n- **Definition is demanding:** “Better than H200” here is a specific technical threshold (FP8 >4 PFLOPS and HBM ≥4.8 TB/s). The obvious candidates are Nvidia’s newest top-end datacenter parts (e.g., Blackwell family). Those are exactly the chips most likely to remain restricted because they most directly increase frontier training capability.\n- **Yes is still possible because of the recent H200 reversal:** The fact that H200 was publicly permitted (apparently via presidential announcement) shows that sudden policy shifts can happen, and the resolution criteria allow a relatively informal but credible presidential statement to count. Also, a “ship first, clarify later” dynamic could in principle produce qualifying exports—though for such high-profile parts, credible reporting of violations/enforcement would be likely if exports weren’t actually permitted.\n\nOverall, I overweight the status quo (No) given the short horizon and the political salience of allowing anything beyond H200.\n\nProbability: 12%\n\n---\n\nRun 5 (22%):\n(a) **Time left:** 61 days (from **2026-01-12** to **2026-03-14**, ET).\n\n(b) **Status quo if nothing changed:** **No.** The currently discussed/cleared ceiling is **H200**; there is no public indication that the U.S. will permit exports of **anything more capable than H200** to mainland China in this window.\n\n(c) **No scenario (brief):** The U.S. continues processing/allowing **H200** licenses/shipments (possibly with fees/conditions) while keeping **B200/GB200-class** and any other “better-than-H200” GPUs either explicitly restricted, stuck in review, or simply not publicly authorized before March 14.\n\n(d) **Yes scenario (brief):** The White House/Commerce publicly announces that **B200/GB200 (or another qualifying post‑H200 GPU)** will be permitted for export to mainland China (possibly with a tariff/fee or licensing regime), **or** credible reporting shows such GPUs shipped to China without violation/enforcement claims.\n\n---\n\n## Rationale\n\n**Baseline / status quo weight:** The most robust fact pattern in the provided reporting is that policy movement has been **toward allowing H200** (with a 25% fee) while simultaneously keeping the broader area under **political sensitivity and active review**. In a slow-changing world, the default is that the newly established “allowed” line (H200) remains the line for at least a few months—especially given the history of iterative tightening/clarifying rules and the attention these decisions attract.\n\n**What must happen for “Yes” is a high bar in a short window:**\n- The resolution requires either (1) a **public U.S. statement clearly permitting** export of a GPU *better than H200* (as defined), or (2) **actual exports** of such GPUs to mainland China **without** credible violation/enforcement reporting.\n- Public permission for something beyond H200 would be a **fresh, salient policy step**—likely to trigger immediate coverage and pushback. That kind of step can happen quickly, but it’s not the “default” continuation of the current trajectory.\n\n**Policy direction signals are mixed, but the mix still favors “No”:**\n- The Trump shift to allow H200 suggests willingness to loosen relative to late-2025 expectations (e.g., the reported plan to block B30A). That increases the chance of further loosening versus a world where H200 remained banned.\n- However, the same news environment includes a **U.S. review** of advanced chip sales and visible controversy. That tends to **cap** near-term expansion beyond the newly permitted H200, at least until the H200 policy is operationalized and politically absorbed.\n\n**Operational/market considerations also lean “No” by March 14:**\n- Even if NVIDIA would like to sell more capable parts, getting to a **clear public authorization** (or clean, widely reported shipments) for B200/GB200-class hardware to mainland China within ~2 months is nontrivial.\n- The question’s technical threshold (FP8 > 4 PFLOPS and HBM ≥ 4.8 TB/s) likely corresponds to NVIDIA’s very top-end current generation; those are exactly the parts most likely to remain controlled.\n\n**Bottom line:** The recent H200 permission is meaningful, but it looks like a **specific carve-out** rather than the start of an immediate, rapid opening to the very best NVIDIA accelerators. With only ~2 months, I’d still anchor on “No,” while assigning a non-negligible tail risk that a further policy announcement happens.\n\nProbability: 22%",
