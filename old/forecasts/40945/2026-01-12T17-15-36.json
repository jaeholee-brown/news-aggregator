A simple continuation would imply a small further drift down, roughly around 40.5%–41.5%.\n\n(d) Expectations of experts and markets: I don’t have a live betting/forecast market or a consensus analyst poll for the *household rating* specifically. Public commentary is more focused on total viewers/reach records (boosted by streaming and improved out-of-home measurement) than on HHLD rating, which has recently sat in the low 40s.\n\n(e) Unexpected low scenario: a lopsided/low-drama game (or a matchup with unusually weak national pull) plus heavy out-of-home viewing (bars/parties) could reduce measured TV-household incidence, pushing the HHLD rating into the high 30s.\n\n(f) Unexpected high scenario: a very close, high-stakes game featuring a major “national draw” team(s), plus strong in-home viewing (bad weather keeping people home, fewer competing events), could push the HHLD rating back toward the mid-40s.\n\nPercentile 10: 37.5  \nPercentile 20: 39.0  \nPercentile 40: 41.0  \nPercentile 60: 42.5  \nPercentile 80: 44.5  \nPercentile 90: 46.0\n\n---\n\nRun 2:\n(a) Time left until the outcome is known: about 2 months (Super Bowl LX is Feb 8, 2026; Nielsen should report well before Mar 14, 2026).\n\n(b) Outcome if nothing changed: use the most recent comparable Nielsen HHLD rating as the baseline: 41.7% (Super Bowl LIX, 2025).\n\n(c) Outcome if the current trend continued: recent HHLD ratings have been volatile but slightly down from the 2024 bump (43.5% → 41.7%). A simple continuation would put LX around 40.5%–41.5%.\n\n(d) Expectations of experts and markets: I don’t have a clean “market” price for HHLD rating specifically, and public commentary tends to focus on total viewers/reach rather than HHLD rating. The best proxy is the recent realized range (roughly 38%–44% since 2021) with the last two at 43.5% and 41.7%, suggesting “low 40s” is the consensus-like expectation.\n\n(e) Unexpected low scenario: a lopsided, low-drama game combined with major audience fragmentation (more out-of-home viewing not well captured in HHLD, or measurement/coverage quirks) pushes the HHLD rating down into the high 30s.\n\n(f) Unexpected high scenario: a close game featuring very high-draw teams/players plus strong cross-platform distribution that still credits TV households well (and/or a methodology change that lifts HHLD) pushes the rating back to mid-40s.\n\nReminder to self: be humble—single-year sports ratings can swing on matchup quality, game competitiveness, and measurement details; set a wide 90/10 interval.\n\nPercentile 10: 37.5  \nPercentile 20: 39.0  \nPercentile 40: 41.0  \nPercentile 60: 42.5  \nPercentile 80: 44.5  \nPercentile 90: 46.0  \n\n---\n\nRun 3:\n(a) Time left until the outcome is known: about 2 months (Super Bowl LX on 2026-02-08; Nielsen typically reports within days; question annuls if no estimate by 2026-03-14).\n\n(b) Outcome if nothing changed: use the most recent comparable Nielsen HHLD rating as the baseline: Super Bowl LIX (2025) was 41.7%.\n\n(c) Outcome if the current trend continued: recent HHLD ratings have been volatile but roughly flat-to-slightly-down over the last few years (LVIII 43.5 → LIX 41.7). Extrapolating that mild decline suggests something like ~41.0–41.5%.\n\n(d) Expectations of experts and markets: I don’t have access here to a live prediction market or a consensus “expert” forecast specifically for Nielsen HHLD rating. Public commentary has emphasized record *viewers* (average-minute audience and especially reach), but that has not translated into a return to the higher household ratings seen in the 2007–2018 era; the recent “normal” for HHLD rating looks to be in the high-30s to low-40s.\n\n(e) Unexpected low-outcome scenario: a lopsided/low-drama game (early blowout), combined with unusually strong competing live events or a major news event that pulls attention away, leading to more tune-out and fewer households watching.\n\n(f) Unexpected high-outcome scenario: a very close game featuring a major “national draw” matchup (big-market teams and/or a superstar narrative), plus unusually effective distribution/measurement capture (e.g., better inclusion of streaming/out-of-home in the household metric), pushing the HHLD rating back toward the mid-40s.\n\nI remind myself that good forecasters are humble and set wide 90/10 confidence intervals to account for unknown unknowns.\n\nPercentile 10: 37.5  \nPercentile 20: 39.0  \nPercentile 40: 40.8  \nPercentile 60: 42.2  \nPercentile 80: 44.0  \nPercentile 90: 45.5\n\n---\n\nRun 4:\n(a) Time left until the outcome is known: about 2 months (Super Bowl LX is Feb 8, 2026; Nielsen should report well before Mar 14, 2026).\n\n(b) Outcome if nothing changed: roughly the most recent comparable Nielsen HHLD Rating, 41.7% (Super Bowl LIX).\n\n(c) Outcome if the current trend continued: recent household ratings have been volatile but broadly flat-to-slightly-down from the 2024 spike (43.5) to 2025 (41.7). Extrapolating that mild reversion suggests something like 41.0%–42.0%.\n\n(d) Expectations of experts and markets: public “expert” discussion tends to emphasize record total viewers/reach, but the directly relevant HHLD rating has recently sat in the low 40s (roughly 38–44 since 2021). I’d expect most informed forecasts to cluster around ~41%–43%, with meaningful uncertainty from game competitiveness, teams, and measurement/platform mix.\n\n(e) Unexpected low scenario: a lopsided/low-interest matchup (or a blowout early) combined with unusually high out-of-home viewing (fewer TV households tuned in at home) could push the HHLD rating into the high 30s.\n\n(f) Unexpected high scenario: a highly compelling, close game featuring major national-draw teams/players, plus strong in-home viewing conditions (bad weather in large markets, fewer competing events) could lift HHLD rating back toward mid-40s.\n\nI’m staying humble and using a wide interval because single-game ratings are noisy and depend heavily on matchup/game script and viewing context.\n\nPercentile 10: 37.5  \nPercentile 20: 39.0  \nPercentile 40: 41.0  \nPercentile 60: 42.5  \nPercentile 80: 44.5  \nPercentile 90: 46.0\n\n---\n\nRun 5:\n(a) Time left until the outcome is known: about 2 months (Super Bowl LX on 2026-02-08; Nielsen rating should be published shortly after, and must be out by 2026-03-14).\n\n(b) Outcome if nothing changed: use the most recent directly comparable Nielsen HHLD rating as the baseline: Super Bowl LIX (2025) was 41.7%.\n\n(c) Outcome if the current trend continued: recent HHLD ratings have been volatile but roughly flat-to-slightly-down from the 2024 spike (43.5 in 2024 down to 41.7 in 2025). A simple continuation would imply a small further dip, roughly 40.5%–41.5%.\n\n(d) Expectations of experts and markets: I don’t have a reliable, directly comparable “market” consensus for *Nielsen HHLD rating* specifically (most public discussion is about total viewers / average minute audience). The best “expert prior” is the recent realized range since 2021 (~38–44) with a central tendency around ~41–42.\n\n(e) Unexpected low scenario: a lopsided/low-drama game plus major audience fragmentation or measurement/availability issues (e.g., prominent streaming or distribution problems, or unusually strong competing live events) pushes HHLD rating down into the high 30s.\n\n(f) Unexpected high scenario: an especially compelling matchup (close game, star-driven narrative, big halftime draw) combined with favorable viewing conditions (bad weather keeping people home, fewer competing events) lifts HHLD rating back toward the mid-40s.\n\nI’m staying humble and using a fairly wide 90/10 interval given game-specific uncertainty (teams, competitiveness), viewing-location shifts (home vs. out-of-home), and ongoing measurement evolution.\n\n\"\nPercentile 10: 37.5\nPercentile 20: 39.0\nPercentile 40: 40.8\nPercentile 60: 42.2\nPercentile 80: 44.0\nPercentile 90: 45.5\n\"",
