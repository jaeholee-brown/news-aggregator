  "reasoning": "Median CDF (first 10 values): [0.0, 0.005, 0.01, 0.015, 0.02, 0.025000000000000005, 0.03, 0.035, 0.04, 0.04499999999999999]...\n\nRun 1:\n(a) Time left until the outcome is known: **35 days** (release on **2026-02-16**, from **2026-01-12**).\n\n(b) Outcome if nothing changed: **0.00% m/m** (if the Jan 2026 WPI index equaled Dec 2025).\n\n(c) Outcome if the current trend continued: Recent m/m prints have been **choppy** with a notable **+0.71% m/m in Nov 2025** (per PIB table cited by your assistant). If we assume a “still-volatile but slightly positive” near-term pattern continues into January (helped by typical seasonal firming in some food items and manufactured goods, offset by weak fuel), a reasonable continuation guess is around **+0.20% to +0.40% m/m**.\n\n(d) Expectations of experts and markets: I don’t have a reliable, quoted **consensus forecast for Jan 2026 m/m WPI** in the materials provided. Public commentary in late 2025 emphasized **y/y deflation/near-zero** driven by food and fuel, but that does not pin down the **month-on-month** January move. So I treat “market expectations” as **centered near a small positive m/m**, with wide uncertainty.\n\n(e) Unexpected scenario for a low outcome: A sharp, broad-based commodity downdraft (e.g., **crude oil falling quickly**, plus renewed declines in **food articles** due to an unusually strong winter harvest/arrivals and weak demand) could push WPI **meaningfully negative m/m**.\n\n(f) Unexpected scenario for a high outcome: A sudden supply shock (e.g., **spike in global oil**, logistics disruption, or weather-driven jump in **vegetables/pulses**), combined with pass-through into manufactured inputs, could produce a **large positive** January m/m print.\n\nReminder to self: be humble; WPI m/m is noisy and revisions don’t matter here, so set a **wide 90/10 interval**.\n\nPercentile 10: -0.60  \nPercentile 20: -0.30  \nPercentile 40: 0.05  \nPercentile 60: 0.30  \nPercentile 80: 0.70  \nPercentile 90: 1.10\n\n---\n\nRun 2:\n(a) Time left until the outcome is known: **35 days** (release scheduled **2026-02-16**).\n\n(b) Outcome if nothing changed: if **Jan 2026 WPI = Dec 2025 WPI**, then the m/m inflation rate would be **0.00%**.\n\n(c) Outcome if the current trend continued: the latest cited m/m move is **+0.71% (Nov vs Oct 2025)**; if that kind of monthly pace persisted into Jan 2026, a rough continuation guess would be around **+0.50% to +0.80% m/m** (allowing for typical volatility/seasonality).\n\n(d) Expectations of experts and markets: there isn’t a clean, widely-quoted “Jan 2026 m/m WPI” consensus in the provided material. What is clear from official releases and market commentary is: **y/y WPI fell into mild deflation in late 2025**, while **m/m prints remained choppy and sometimes positive**. That backdrop suggests markets would not be surprised by a **small positive** January m/m print, but with meaningful uncertainty.\n\n(e) Unexpected scenario for a low outcome: a sharp, broad-based **commodity downswing** (notably **crude/mineral oils**) plus another leg down in **food articles** (good harvest arrivals, aggressive price corrections) could produce a **negative** Jan m/m WPI.\n\n(f) Unexpected scenario for a high outcome: a **sudden oil spike** (geopolitical disruption) combined with **winter food price pressures** (vegetables/pulses) and firmer **manufactured input costs** could push Jan m/m WPI to a **clearly positive** reading (near or above 1%).\n\nI’m staying humble: WPI m/m is volatile, and January can be affected by commodity shocks and food seasonality, so I’m setting a wide 90/10 interval.\n\nPercentile 10: -0.80  \nPercentile 20: -0.40  \nPercentile 40: 0.10  \nPercentile 60: 0.50  \nPercentile 80: 1.00  \nPercentile 90: 1.50\n\n---\n\nRun 3:\n(a) Time left until the outcome is known: **35 days** (release scheduled **2026-02-16**).\n\n(b) Outcome if nothing changed: if **Jan 2026 WPI = Dec 2025 WPI**, then m/m inflation would be **0.00%**.\n\n(c) Outcome if the current trend continued: the latest cited m/m move is **+0.71%** (Nov 2025 vs Oct 2025). If that kind of monthly pace persisted into Jan 2026, a rough continuation-implied m/m would be around **+0.70%** (recognizing WPI is volatile and seasonality can differ).\n\n(d) Expectations of experts and markets: **no clear published consensus** in the provided material for **Jan 2026 m/m**. What is observable is that late-2025 **y/y** was slightly negative while **m/m** could still be positive (e.g., Nov 2025), suggesting markets should allow for **small positive or small negative** monthly prints around year-end/early-year.\n\n(e) Unexpected low-outcome scenario: a sharp, broad-based commodity downswing (e.g., **crude/mineral oils drop**, plus another leg down in **food articles** due to an unusually strong winter crop supply) could push Jan m/m to around **-1.00% or lower**.\n\n(f) Unexpected high-outcome scenario: a supply shock (e.g., **spike in global oil**, logistics disruption, or weather-driven jump in **vegetables/cereals**) combined with firm manufactured-goods input costs could produce a Jan m/m around **+1.50% or higher**.\n\nPercentile 10: -1.00  \nPercentile 20: -0.60  \nPercentile 40: -0.10  \nPercentile 60: 0.40  \nPercentile 80: 0.90  \nPercentile 90: 1.50\n\n---\n\nRun 4:\n(a) Time left until the outcome is known: **35 days** (release scheduled **2026-02-16**).\n\n(b) Outcome if nothing changed: if **WPI in Jan 2026 equaled Dec 2025**, then the monthly inflation rate would be **0.00%**.\n\n(c) Outcome if the current trend continued: the latest cited m/m move is **+0.71%** (Nov 2025 vs Oct 2025, PIB). If that kind of near-term momentum broadly persisted into January (a big “if,” given volatility/seasonality), a rough continuation-implied outcome would be around **+0.50% to +0.80% m/m**.\n\n(d) Expectations of experts and markets: I don’t have a reliable, directly-quoted **consensus forecast for Jan 2026 m/m WPI** in the provided materials. What we do have is: (i) late-2025 **y/y WPI around/under 0%** and (ii) **m/m volatility** with at least one recent strong positive print. That combination suggests markets would likely expect a **small positive** January m/m number rather than a large deflationary print, but with meaningful uncertainty.\n\n(e) Unexpected low-outcome scenario: a sharp **commodity/fuel downswing** (global crude drop) plus renewed **food price declines** (good winter harvest arrivals, lower vegetable/cereal wholesale prices) could produce a **negative m/m** print (e.g., **-0.6% or lower**).\n\n(f) Unexpected high-outcome scenario: a **fuel spike** (oil shock/rupee depreciation raising import costs) combined with **food supply disruptions** (unseasonal weather hitting rabi crops, logistics issues) and firmer manufactured input costs could push m/m WPI to **+1.2% or higher**.\n\nPercentile 10: -0.60  \nPercentile 20: -0.30  \nPercentile 40: 0.10  \nPercentile 60: 0.40  \nPercentile 80: 0.80  \nPercentile 90: 1.20\n\n---\n\nRun 5:\n(a) Time left until the outcome is known: **35 days** (release on **2026-02-16**).\n\n(b) Outcome if nothing changed: if **WPI in Jan 2026 equaled Dec 2025**, then the monthly inflation rate would be **0.00%**.\n\n(c) Outcome if the current trend continued: late-2025 WPI has shown **choppy but often positive m/m prints** even while y/y dipped negative (e.g., **+0.71% m/m in Nov 2025** per PIB table). If we assume a more “typical” continuation of recent m/m behavior rather than repeating a large jump, that suggests something like **+0.20% to +0.50% m/m** for Jan.\n\n(d) Expectations of experts and markets: I don’t have a reliable, directly comparable **consensus forecast for Jan 2026 m/m WPI** in the provided materials (most commentary focuses on y/y). Given (i) recent m/m volatility around small positives and (ii) the narrative that 2025 disinflation was heavily food-driven (which can reverse seasonally), I’d infer “market expectations” would likely cluster around a **small positive** monthly print, roughly **+0.20% to +0.40%**.\n\n(e) Unexpected low-outcome scenario: a renewed **sharp drop in food articles** (good winter crop arrivals / supply glut) combined with **another leg down in global crude/mineral oils** and weak basic metals could produce a **negative m/m** print (e.g., **-0.50% or lower**).\n\n(f) Unexpected high-outcome scenario: a **commodity shock** (oil spike), plus **weather-related food price jump** (vegetables/pulses) and pass-through into manufactured inputs could push Jan m/m to **+1.00% or higher**.\n\nPercentile 10: -0.60  \nPercentile 20: -0.25  \nPercentile 40: 0.10  \nPercentile 60: 0.35  \nPercentile 80: 0.70  \nPercentile 90: 1.10",
